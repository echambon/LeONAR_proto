# LeONAR_proto

LeONAR is a personal project to develop a Navigation and Routing Application. The purpose is to allow navigators to download weather gribs and automatically compute the optimal surface route considering wind and stream so as to follow the expected ground route.

Maps are based on OpenStreetMap tile system. Additional layers (such as OpenSeaMap for navigational data) are currently not supported but will be in a foreseeable future.

# Tiles generation

To generate map tiles, we advise using Maperitive.
