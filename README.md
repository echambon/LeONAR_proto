# LeONAR

LeONAR is a personal project to develop a Navigation and Routing Application. The purpose is to allow navigators to download weather gribs and automatically compute the optimal surface route considering wind and stream so as to follow the expected ground route.

Maps are based on OpenStreetMap tile system also used by OpenSeaMap project (or any system using web Mercator projection with 256x256 tiles).

# Tiles generation

To generate map tiles, we advise using Maperitive.

# MATLAB version

LeONAR prototype is running with MATLAB R2019b.
